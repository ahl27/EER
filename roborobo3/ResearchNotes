costs energy to pick up pucks (flat rate), energy given depends on specialization
Investigate energy
Look into crossover??
look into incubation/dormancy

Do more runs, write a quick plotter
look into research question


Possible Research Questions:
-MONEE: very difficult to replicate
-mEDEA:
    -Measure impact of explicitly favoring exploration
    -use mEDEA to explore a search space
    --initialize pucks on entire search space
    --replace every generation
    --incentivize distance travelled
    --run simulation on testbed, then randomly select certain number of agents and place in new environment
    -Performance of algorithm on a real system with larger populations
    --Previous investigations have only used small population sizes (5-20 robots)
    --Measure performance in a larger system
    --can probably use a set of RasPi Zeros, would have to design a minimal robot

-VanillaEE:
    -directly incentivize exploration
    -extend VanillaEE algorithm to different environments
    --previous experiment hypothesized reproductive isolation 
    --measure impact of different puck distributions on specialization

    -paper states further investigation could look into "very different behaviors"
    --ex. green pucks can only be collected with front, red pucks only with back


plot std dev too
